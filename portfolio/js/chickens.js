She is valuable in this way as an incubator. We ditched our electric incubator as Babock has a higher hatch success rate then it did!"

Even with their smaller size, they make a good dual-purpose chicken. They can be used for meat once their laying production declines. While our family prefers brown or blue eggs, Gracie lays an extra large egg almost every day of the year, so she's a keeper!"
