                                I grew up in a suburban environment and most of the yards in our neighborhood 
                                were large, yet very few were growing anything edible. When I moved to Seattle  
                                as an adult, I was impressed to see quite the opposite! I started to dabble in a 
                                tiny apartment garden, and was able to grow most of the greens that I usually 
                                purchase at the store or farmer's market. Since becoming a parent, 
                                I've become even more discriminating about what our family eats. The more 
                                I learn about the impacts of large scale commercial agriculture on our environment 
                                and communities, the less I want to support those systems. Further, the food coming 
                                out of commercial agriculture lacks nutritional diversity. There are few things as 
                                tasty, nutritious, and sastisfying as fresh produce right from your garden!
                                <br><br>Tips for success in a backyard farm and garden:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Keep it small.</b> The first mistake we made was trying to get everything 
                                        up and running the very first season. It takes time to build up the soil 
                                        nutrients, especially in a backyard, which typically has compacted clay 
                                        with very little (if any) topsoil. Starting with one growing area at a 
                                        time and pacing ourselves minimized the amount of work we spent fixing our 
                                        mistakes. It also helped keep morale up! Farming is hard work. </li>
                                    <li><b>Focus on perennials.</b> Most commercial farms grow only annuals crops 
                                         like corn, wheat, and lettuce. This results in complete replanting every 
                                         year, intensive tilling which depletes the soil, and so much extra work!
                                         In our garden we have tried to install a permanent edible landscape to 
                                         reduce our own workload and to increase the resiliency of our food source. 
                                         You see, perennial plants have natural adaptations to withstand seasonal 
                                         and annual fluctations in conditions. They tend to survive periods of 
                                         heat, flooding, and pest infestation better than most annual crops. 
                                         Also, we are lazy and don't want to have to replant every spring!</li>
                                    <li><b>Plant what you'll eat.</b> It's really easy to grow radishes just about 
                                         anywhere in your yard, but will you want to eat them? We didn't, and so 
                                         they ended up in with the food scraps for the chickens (and then the compost 
                                         pile). Assess which produce you purchase the most and see if there is a 
                                         good place in your yard for it to grow. </li>
                                    <li><b>Choose a diversity.</b> Don't limit yourself to one type of produce, or 
                                         even to one variety of produce. We've found mixed plantings to be the most 
                                         sucessful. Sometimes the whiteflies love one type of kale but leave the 
                                         others untouched. Different varieties of peas will be ready for harvest at 
                                         different times, so by growing a mixture you'll have fresh peas every 
                                         week. Also, learning which plants like to grow together helps to reduce 
                                         plant stress and disease.</li>
                                    <li><b>Be creative.</b> Creating a garden can be very fun and rewarding. Make it 
                                         your own! There are so many ways to put the components together.</li>

                                <h4>Benefits of Backyard Chickens</h4>
                                The trend of keeping backyard chickens has been on the rise over the past number of years, and 
                                it's easy to see why. Of course, there are the fresh eggs to look forward to, but did you know 
                                that chickens have a lot else going for them?
                                From free therapy to learning about self-sustainability, here are 20 great reasons to keep your 
                                own backyard chickens:
                                <h4>Fresh Eggs</h4>
                                This is the obvious reason - you'll have a supply of fresh eggs on hand. Not to mention the 
                                convenience, as you'll have absolutely no need to get out of your pajamas and head to the store 
                                to make a fresh, healthy breakfast.
                                <h4>Organic & Non-GMO</h4>
                                Caged hens are fed a diet of corn, soy and cottonseed meals - three huge GMO crops. If you really 
                                take the old saying "you are what you eat" to heart, then you'll be wary of eggs which come from 
                                these hens. By keeping your own, you know exactly what they're eating and can avoid feeding them 
                                engineered and antibiotic laden crops.
                                <h4>Greater Nutrition</h4>
                                Free range eggs from your backyard have been shown to have a far greater nutritional 
                                value than nasty battery eggs. There is more than seven times the Vitamin A and 
                                Beta Carotene (essential for good eyesight) and almost double the Vitamin E in 
                                free range eggs. When it comes to the essential fatty acid Omega 3 (which is 
                                necessary for heart health, healthy cholesterol levels as well as positive mental and 
                                behavioral health) the free range variety win again with an incredible 292mg, 
                                versus a pitiful 0.033mg in battery eggs. You'll also get less saturated fat in 
                                free range eggs.
                                <h4>Cruelty Free</h4>
                                Not only will you get nutritious, organic eggs, but you can be safe in the knowledge 
                                that your omelet is served up cruelty free. You may think you're already supporting 
                                a cruelty free life for farmed chickens by buying free range but, the truth is, 
                                commercially marketed "free range" eggs don't have the happy origins that the 
                                industry would like you to believe. There is actually no definite description of 
                                what "free range" is and, even then, less than 1% of chickens in the US are 
                                considered to be free range.
                                <h4>Educational Value</h4>
                                Did you know chickens have a great memory and can differentiate between over 100 
                                human or animal faces? They love to play, they dream, they mourn for each other 
                                and they feel pain and distress. They also make great mothers - they talk to their 
                                chicks while still in the egg, and turn the eggs about 50 times a day. The term 
                                "pecking order" didn't come out of nowhere - hens have an ordered social structure 
                                based on a hierarchy. If you make room for them in your back garden, you and your 
                                family will get to learn all about these fascinating creatures up close. Have a 
                                look here for even more amazing facts about chickens.
                                <h4>Save a Life</h4>
                                Be a hero and save ex-battery hens from the slaughterhouse. 300 million birds each 
                                year are crammed into cages that are far too small. Why not play a part in giving 
                                some a second chance? They'll reward you with their protein rich eggs and companionship.
                                <h4>Free Fertilizer</h4>
                                Maybe free chicken manure isn't something to get too excited about, but if you're 
                                proud of your garden it can work wonders. Chicken manure is actually classed as being 
                                one of the most desirable manures due to its high nutrient level. Utilizing this is an 
                                important part of sustainable and organic agriculture. It's estimated that having 
                                between 5 and 10 chickens should produce enough fertilizer to take care of your entire 
                                vegetable garden and yard for the year. It's also great to add to your compost.
                                <h4>Pest Control</h4>
                                When you get your backyard chickens, you'll have a great excuse to ditch the pesticides 
                                and chemical-laden bug killers. Your chickens will do that job for you. They eat pretty 
                                much any bug including beetles, slugs, ticks and grasshoppers. Between a steady supply 
                                of fertilizer and a newly slug-free garden, your veggies will never have looked so good.
                                <h4>Cut Down on Food Waste</h4>
                                Nationwide, food scraps make up about 17% (29 million tons) of what is sent to landfills, 
                                and yard waste is slightly more at 33 million tons. Your chickens can help you out here too! 
                                In addition to some chicken food, they'll eat pretty much most kitchen scraps - fruit and vegetable peelings, 
                                bread, cooked beans, cooked rice, oatmeal, pasta - the list goes on. They can't have all 
                                foods though so make sure you know what's bad for them too. Meat and other animal products are best avoided.
                                <h4>Save Heritage Breeds</h4>
                                Because only certain chickens are good for meat, and others are especially bred for maximum 
                                egg production, today's chickens look significantly different from their ancestors.
                                You could take on the role of conservationist by adding a few rare heritage breeds to 
                                your yard. Different breeds have different characteristics so choose which breed is 
                                right for you based on their temperament, and your location and available space.
                                <h4>Weed Control</h4>
                                Chickens may just be the perfect sidekick for every gardener. A source of pest control 
                                and manure all in one, they also will rid your garden of those invasive weeds that 
                                pop up all over the place. As they scratch and claw the ground, they eat and disperse 
                                all those weed seeds that have blown in. Next year, you'll be amazed at your neat and tidy garden.
                                <h4>A Source of Therapy</h4>
                                Move over cats and dogs, these beautiful creatures could be the next therapy animals! 
                                They're already being used to help those with autism as well as the elderly.
                                Keeping chickens is seen as therapeutic for children on the autism spectrum by getting 
                                the kids involved in feeding and caring for the chickens, thereby promoting independent 
                                living skills. They have also been used for patients with dementia and other psychiatric 
                                disorders. Because chickens are always moving around, pecking and socializing, they're seen as calming.
                                <h4>Learn Where Food Comes From</h4>
                                Keeping chickens is a great way for kids to learn about nature, agriculture and the 
                                responsibility of caring for animals. It's also a fantastic way for both kids and adults 
                                to gain respect for these intelligent creatures that produce food for us.
                                <h4>Entertainment Value</h4>
                                Because chickens are clever creatures, each occupying a different role in the pecking 
                                order, keeping them in your backyard gives you a chance to see the individual personalities 
                                and quirks of each of your new pets.
                                <h4>Cut Down on Food Miles</h4>
                                We've all heard of food miles - the distance over which a food item is transported 
                                from producer to consumer. Well, you can't cut down on this particular type of environmental 
                                impact much more than keeping a source of food in your own back garden. As you also clock 
                                up miles getting waste foods away from you and to the landfill, it seems these useful 
                                creatures save you miles twice when they gobble up your table scraps too!
                                <h4>A Lesson in Self-Sustainability</h4>
                                If you already grow your own vegetables and keep a compost heap then you're heading 
                                in the right direction to becoming self-sustaining. Keeping your own chickens is the 
                                next step - for the eggs, the pest and weed control and the simple source of fertilizer.
                                Plus, you don't have to worry about egg shortages or recalls due to salmonella outbreaks!
                                <h4>A Taste of Country Life</h4>
                                Did you always want to live in the country but your job or your family meant you needed 
                                to be by the city? Well, keeping backyard chickens is one way of bringing country life to the city!
                                They don't need much room to be happy (of course, it depends on how many you keep) and  
                                you'll get a taste of keeping your own animals and collecting your own food - fresh from your mini-farm.
                                <h4>The Social Aspect</h4>
                                Would you believe there are entire communities dedicated to raising backyard chickens? 
                                Just do a quick internet search and you'll see. It's a great way to share your newfound 
                                passion with others, to pick up some tips and tricks, and to brag about how great 
                                the new additions to your family are. It's good for real-life socializing too. Mentioning you 
                                keep chickens is a great conversation starter and I'll bet your kid's friends want to 
                                come over and check out these cool creatures.
                                <h4>It's Cheap</h4>
                                Yes, there are initial start-up costs. You'll need to buy or build a chicken coop, ensure 
                                your new pets are kept safe from predators and invest in food and feeding equipment.
                                Once it's all set up though, it's relatively inexpensive to care for these quirky ladies. 
                                You'll be cutting down on household waste (and garbage costs), you'll have rich soil to 
                                grow your own crops, you won't need to splurge on weed killer or insect repellent and, 
                                of course, you'll get cheap organic eggs - which can sometimes be a little pricey in the store. 
                                Don't forget the free therapy, companionship and amusement.
                                All in all, it's a pretty good deal!
                                <h4>A Fun Hobby</h4>
                                What else would you get up to on a Sunday afternoon than spend time with your chicks? 
                                Sure, it might seem like an odd choice of pastime to some - but so is stamp collecting.
                                As hobbies go, it's a pretty low-maintenance one and can be a lot more rewarding than making a jigsaw puzzle.
