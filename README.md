## About Me
> My name is Amy Baum and I am a graduate student at the University of Washington in the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences in Seattle, WA. I am in the process of developing a research project centered around exploring the impacts of climate change on important food crops and how those impacts will affect food security, particularly in urban areas where reliance upon imported foods is high. As part of my research, I will be collaborating with outreach programs that distribute information for the general public online, therefore web development will be a component of my research. 

> At home, we have an urban farm and keep a flock of backyard chickens. I created this site to document our flock and to educate others on how rewarding and fun it can be to keep your own flock of backyard chickens.
